This repository contains the code necessary for building a Flogo App that accepts in data transforms it with CatalystML and makes an inference on whether the credit card charge is fraudulent or not.  Creating the CatalystML transformations and (quickly) creating a DL model is [here](https://medium.com/@avanderg/catalyzing-real-time-data-for-machine-learning-in-production-part-1-67ad5432898e) medium blog post (partI).  The files and medium post for creating a rest API as a Flogo app are coming shortly.
